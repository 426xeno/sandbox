This repository contains exercises, projects, and notes that reflect my journey in computer science. It documents my learning process from basic syntax to more complex programming.

The exercises cover key topics like variables, control flow, data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming, helping me build the skills I need for my goal of transitioning into full-stack web development. I hope to add more projects and notes to highlight practical applications as I continue to grow.
